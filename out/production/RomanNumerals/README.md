**How the problem was approached**

Having read around Roman numerals a little, and as a former maths teacher, 
I decided that the best way to tackle this problem was to think about it 
in terms of a both an integer's + Roman numeral's place value. 

Once I made that decision, writing an effective program to solve this 
problem was a matter of creating helper functions that defined the Roman 
numeral equivalent of those place values and returned them to the 
primary function for further processing.

Example: 
The number 1565
